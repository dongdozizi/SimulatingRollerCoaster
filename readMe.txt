Author		: < Insert you name here >
USC ID 		: < Insert your USC ID here >

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based texture mapping and Phong shading to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : - Y
  level 2 : - Y
  Level 3 : -
  Level 4 : -
  Level 5 : -

3. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation -

4. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) -

5. Understandably written, well commented code -

6. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots -
